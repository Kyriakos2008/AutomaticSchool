# AutomaticSchool
Written in Python using the PyAutoGui library for the mouse functions and the screen scanning.

To use mute.py just click start and while you are in a meeting it will make it almost imposible to speak/unmute.
To use AutoSchool.py you have to set your MS Teams caalendar to show work days on fullscreen and then push the start button and it will automaticaly join the meetings
and leave after 30 minutes. The times used are the school times in cyprus so if you live in cyprus enjoy. :)
